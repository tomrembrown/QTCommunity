Carmen (Rosy Rodriguez) is 17, engaged, and ready to follow the path her family has already paved for her, while Lola (Zaira Morales) is a soft-spoken, graffiti artist who has big aspirations. When the two meet, both of their lives take an unexpected turn. <em>Carmen &amp; Lola</em> explores queer sexuality in a genuine way, as the protagonists attempt to navigate their feelings and the familial traditions that have been forced upon them. Echevarr&amp;iacute;a effectively conveys the difficulty of trying to balance love, family relationships, religion, and figuring out what it means to be a woman. Despite its colourful scenery and beautiful bittersweet moments, <em>Carmen &amp; Lola</em> will break your heart, but it will also give you hope for new beginnings.</p></div></div></div><p><em>No one under 25 turned away for lack of funds!
