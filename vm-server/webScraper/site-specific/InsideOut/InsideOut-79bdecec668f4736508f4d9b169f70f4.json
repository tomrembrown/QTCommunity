She meets a girl named Graham who begins to challenge the camp's ideals and what it means to be gay. Filled to the brim with clever innuendos, colourful imagery, and witty characters, <em>But I'm a Cheerleader</em> is sure to make you smile and laugh while also offering a satirical look at issues surrounding queer identity and gender roles. Using comedy to attack hard-hitting topics like heteronormativity is a change of pace from how these issues are traditionally discussed, and the film doesn't resort to tragic piano music to show us the absurdity of reparative therapy. Using an out-there sense of humour, <em>But I'm a Cheerleader</em> is a vivid exploration of gender, sexuality, and identity &amp;mdash; and it's more relevant today than ever.</p><p><em>No one under 25 turned away for lack of funds!
