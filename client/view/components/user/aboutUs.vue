      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>This website, QueerToronto, is the first in series of community websites built by the social 
        economy enterprise, Ashroh Enterprises. The vision, the why, of this company, Ashroh Enterprises, 
        is to fight the loneliness epidemic by helping people build more authentic relationships, and by 
        building community.</p>
      <p>There are many ways to build community and fight loneliness. To begin with, we are focussing on 
        building community web portals, starting with the Toronto LGBTQ+ population (“Queer Toronto”). 
        Queer Toronto will initially consist of a list of organizations, calendar of events, as well as 
        Project Pink Book; a list of professionals and businesses who are LGBTQ+ allies. There are other 
        websites that list some LGBTQ+ organizations and events in Toronto, but no websites provide a 
        comprehensive list.</p>
      <p>Ashroh Enterprises is a triple-bottom-line company that will be a hybrid customer/employee 
        co-operative. Normally companies have written into their corporate charter that they have a 
        fiduciary duty to maximize shareholder profits above all else - the bottom line. This is why 
        companies will harm the environment, their workers, or the communities they operate in to increase 
        profits - they have a legal duty to do so - written in a legally binding contract between the 
        company and the shareholders. This company, Ashroh Enterprises, is different. It has three bottom 
        lines that will be balanced. One is to maximize shareholder profit; one is to help the communities 
        it operates in; and one is to provide stewardship of the environment in its operations. Furthermore, 
        this company is a partial co-op. Three members of the board of directors will be elected by 
        employees to represent employees needs. People will pay $7 / month to become a consumer-member of 
        the company. When they do this they will get greater access to the site and the advertisements will 
        be turned off. Also, they will be able to vote on, and run for, one of the three members of the 
        board of directors elected from the consumer-members. Furthermore, the board of directors will 
        choose some decisions to be made by a vote of employees, some to be made by the board of directors 
        itself, and some to be made by a vote of customer-members. The privacy policy is an example of a 
        matter that would be decided by a vote of customer-members.</p>
